# Blog

This is my personal blog built as a **static site (SSG)** using **Next.js**.

I use this repository as a space to write — about technology, ideas, reflections, and things I’m learning along the way. The focus is on simplicity, performance, and content-first design.

## Features

- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Markdown-based posts
- Clean and minimal layout
- Fast load times
- Easy to extend and maintain

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Markdown
- Static export

## Content

All posts are written in Markdown and compiled at build time.  
This keeps the site fast, simple, and easy to version-control.

## Purpose

This project is **personal**.  
It’s not meant to be a framework or template — just a place to think, write, and experiment in public.
