Problems.
More problems.
Endless problems.

This blog talks a lot about problems—because no human being ever lives without them. And every problem, without exception, **has a way out**.

Don’t believe me?

Of course you don’t. You don’t believe it because you feel that *only you* truly understand your problem. Fair enough. I get it. But try, just for a moment, to lower that sense of exclusivity.

I have never lived your life, and I have never stood exactly where you are standing now. But I am human—and like you, I have never escaped problems either. At the very least, I understand the nature of what a problem truly is.

At its core, a problem is simple:
**it is the moment when a human encounters something they do not want.**

Maybe it isn’t your fault. That could be true.
But remember this: you are standing at the birthplace of your problem because *you walked there yourself*.

If both you and another person believe the same individual caused the mess, then blaming recklessly solves nothing. At minimum, consider yourself a 50% shareholder of the problem—because you chose to enter the tiger’s cage. The other 50% belongs to the person who deliberately disrupted your plans with ill intent.

Some problems feel impossible to solve. These usually fall into two categories:

1. Problems you cannot forget
2. Problems you cannot find an exit from

Both types hurt.
Both eat away at your peace.
Both exhaust the soul.

But here is a truth you must accept:

**A problem will never be solved by silence.**

Running away is not a solution—unless you are collapsing. If you must run, run briefly. But understand this: you can never run forever. Time itself will drag you back.

A problem ends only when **something changes**.

And that leads us to the only two fundamental choices you ever have:

1. Change the situation
2. Change yourself

There is no third option.

You already know what needs to be changed. The real issue is that you keep searching for an *easy way out*. But the easy way does not exist.

The difficult path feels terrifying. You know you must act boldly—but you don’t know how. That missing piece is what I call **The X Factor of Bravery**.


## 1. Changing the Situation

Take a simple example: being treated poorly by your parents.
You can talk to them calmly. You can explain—rationally—why that treatment must stop.

You’re afraid, aren’t you?
You hesitate. That’s normal.

But think carefully: is there an easier way?
In all your overthinking, did you ever find a truly easier alternative?

I’m certain you didn’t.

When a wild idea to change the situation appears in your mind, write it down. Note when it appeared. Then give yourself time—set a deadline—to search for alternatives. This process will prove to you that the options you fear are often the *only* options available.

Let me say something uncomfortable but honest:

**Life is heavy. Life always demands sacrifice in exchange for desire.**

If you refuse to sacrifice something—material or emotional—then you are silently asking others to sacrifice for you. And if that is your choice, ask yourself this:
**where is your dignity as a human being?**

Stop asking, *“What should I do?”*
You already know.

The real problem is that you keep labeling your own solution as “impossible.” Worse—you never try.

If after deep reflection only one path remains, even if it feels crazy or absurd, then that path is the answer. Failure does not mean there was another way. More often, it means you tried once, failed, and quit.

**Do not quit.**

## 2. Changing Yourself

Imagine being afraid to meet your thesis advisor—even though it’s the only way forward.

You cannot change the situation so that the advisor comes knocking on your door.
That leaves only one option.

You change yourself.

Fear must be confronted. And in the end, the action required is always the same: **boldness**. Recklessness, even. That is why you need **The X Factor of Bravery**.

## Ask Yourself This:

**Which one must change?**

Shout it if you have to:

*I will not solve this by staying silent. There is no other way. Stop overthinking.*

## Do Not Cry

Crying is a sign that the mind has hit a wall. A sign that you feel hope no longer exists.

Have you ever been rejected by someone you deeply cared about?

Don’t cry. Don’t collapse. You have two choices:

1. Change the situation: continue trying, influence them, give it time
2. Change yourself: accept it, let go, and open yourself to someone new

Rejection does not mean hope is dead. As long as you keep trying, you have not surrendered. And if you refuse to surrender, you will never drown in sorrow over something like this.

Because the hope you chased didn’t die—it simply refused to work *at that moment*.
Try again. Another time. Another way.

**Stay strong.**
